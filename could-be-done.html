<a name="could-be-done-00000"></a><p style="margin-left: 3em;">&quot;The late <a href="http://www.multicians.org/andre.html">André</a> Bensoussan worked with me on the Multics .... We were working  on a major change to the file system ...</p>
<a name="could-be-done-00001"></a><p style="margin-left: 3em;">André took on the job of design, implementation, and test of the VTOC  manager. He started by sitting at his desk and drawing a lot of diagrams. I was  the project coordinator, so I used to drop in on him and ask how things were  going. &quot;Still designing,&quot; he&#x27;d say. He wanted the diagrams to look beautiful  and symmetrical as well as capturing all the state information. ... I was  glad when he finally began writing code. He wrote in pencil, at his desk,  instead of using a terminal. ...</p>
<a name="could-be-done-00002"></a><p style="margin-left: 3em;">Finally André took his neat final pencil copy to a terminal and typed the whole  program in. His first compilation attempt failed; he corrected three typos,  tried again, and the code compiled. We bound it into the system and tried it  out, and it worked the first time.</p>
<a name="could-be-done-00003"></a><p style="margin-left: 3em;">In fact, the VTOC manager worked perfectly from then on. ...</p>
<a name="could-be-done-00004"></a><p style="margin-left: 3em;">How did André do this, with no tool but a pencil?</p>
<a name="could-be-done-00005"></a><p>Those people were programming operating system kernel that supported kernel level multi-threading and SMP (in 60s!), had most features UNIX kernels have now and some that no later operating system has, like transparent HSM. All under hardware constraints that would make modern washing machine to look like a super-computer. Of course they were thinking, <i>then</i> typing.</p><footer><a href="confessions-microsoft.html#confessions-microsoft">&lt;</a>&nbsp;<a href="series_blog_compact_reverse_flat.html">blog</a>&nbsp;<a href="cue.html#cue">&gt;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="leisure.html#leisure">&lt;</a>&nbsp;<a href="series_timeline_compact_reverse_flat.html">timeline</a>&nbsp;<a href="modest-proposal.html#modest-proposal">&gt;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</footer></div>
