Let \(D\) be a category with functorial limits of functors from some category
\(C\). That is, there is a functor

; math
\lim : \Cat(C, D) \to D.

For each object \(x\) from \(C\), there is a functor

; math
ev_x : \Cat(C, D) \to D,

sending a functor \(F : C \to D\) to \(F(x)\), and sending a natural
transformation \(r : F \to G : C \to D\) to its component at \(x\) (\(r_x : F(x)
\to G(x)\)). By mapping \(x\) to \(ev_x\) and morphism \(f : x \to y\) to an
obvious natural transformation from \(ev_x\) to \(ev_y\) we obtain a functor
\(\EV : C \to \Cat(\Cat(C, D), D)\).

Amusing and trivially checkable fact is that \(\lim = \Lim \EV\). That is,
limits are _always_ point-wise.
