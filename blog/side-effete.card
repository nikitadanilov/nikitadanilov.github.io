More of „I know C better than you!“ stuff.

I just discovered (the verb is deeply characteristic) how to write a
`HAS_SIDE_EFFECTS(expr)` macro that doesn't evaluate `expr` and returns true iff
expr has side-effects.

The macro essentially depends on a GCC extension. It is useful, for example, as
a sanity check in conditionally compiled code, e.g., in `assert(expr)`.
