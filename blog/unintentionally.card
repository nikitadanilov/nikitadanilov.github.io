This post is about set theory, which is a framework to reason about collections,
elements and membership.
/ += . "set theory" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory

We start with a informal and naÃ¯ve outline, which is (very loosely) based on a
Godel-Bernays version of set theory. This theory is about sets (collections)
which contain elements, which can in turn be sets. When a set \(X\) contains an
element \(t\), it is written \(t\in X\).
/ += . "Godel-Bernays" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann-Bernays-G%C3%B6del_set_theory

First, set equality has to be defined:

>E0 _Axiom of extensionality_
/ += . "Axiom of extensionality" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_extensionality

; math
>X = Y \equiv (t \in X \equiv t \in Y)

(Here \(\equiv\) is a logical equivalence, pronounced "if and only if".) This
axiom means that sets are equal exactly when they have the same elements. (In
this and following formulae, free variables are implicitly universally
quantified.)
/ += . "if and only if" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iff
/ += . "universally quantified" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification

Subsets are defined by \(X \subseteq Y \equiv (t\in X \Rightarrow t\in Y)\),
that is, X is a subset of Y when every element of X is also an element of
Y. It's easy to check that \(X = Y \equiv (X\subseteq Y \wedge Y\subseteq X)\),
where \(\wedge\) means "and".

Next, a way to build new sets is needed:

>E1 _Axiom of (extensional) comprehension_
/ += . "Axiom of \(extensional\) comprehension" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation

; math
>t \in \{u \mid P(u)\} \equiv P(t)

This axiom introduces a "set-builder notation" \(\{u \mid P(u) \}\) and states
that \(\{u \mid P(u) \}\) is exactly the set of all \(t\) such that \(P(t)\)
holds.

Now, there is already enough machinery for two famous collections to be
immediately constructed: _empty set_, \(\varnothing = \{t \mid false \}\), which
contains no elements, and the collection of all sets: \(U = \{t \mid true \}\),
which contains all possible elements.
/ += . "empty set" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set
/ += . "the collection of all sets" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe_(mathematics)

With these axioms, conventional set operations can be defined:

>singleton: \(\{t\} = \{u\mid u = t\}\), for each \(t\) a singleton set \(\{t\}\) can be constructed that contains \(t\) as its only element. Note that \(t\in\{t\}\)
/ += . "singleton" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(mathematics)

>union: \(X\cup Y = \{t\mid t \in X \vee t \in Y\}\) (\(\vee\) means "or")
/ += . "union" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)

>intersection: \(X\cap Y = \{t\mid t\in X \wedge t\in Y\}\)
/ += . "intersection" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)

>complement: \(\complement X = \{t \mid t \notin X\}\)
/ += . "complement(?=:)" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)

>(unordered) pair: \(\{t,u\} = \{t\}\cup\{u\}\)
/ += . "pair" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unordered_pair

>ordered pair: \((t,u) = \{t, \{t, u\}\}\)
/ += . "ordered pair" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair

>power set: \(\mathfrak{P}(X) = \{t \mid t \subseteq X\}\)
/ += . "power set" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set

From here, one can build hierarchical sets, representing all traditional
mathematical structures, starting with natural numbers:

; math
0 = \varnothing,\quad 1 = \{0\},\quad 2 = \{0, 1\},\quad \ldots,\quad  n + 1 = \{0, \ldots, n\}, \quad \ldots

then integers, rationals, reals, _&c._, adding more axioms (of infinity, of
foundation, of replacement, _&c_.) along the way.
/ += . "infinity" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity
/ += . "foundation" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_regularity
/ += . "replacement" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_replacement

It was discovered quite early that this system is not entirely
satisfactory. First defect is that it is impossible to have elements which are
not sets themselves. For example, one would like to talk about a "set of all
inhabited planets in the Solar system". Elements of this set (planets) are not
sets, they are called _ur-elements_. Unfortunately, the axiom of extensionality
makes all ur-elements equal to the empty set. Note, that this indicates that the
axiom of extensionality doesn't work well with sets that have very few (none)
elements. This was never considered a problem, because all sets of interest to
mathematics can be constructed without ur-elements.
/ += . "ur-elements" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urelement

Another, more serious drawback, arises in the area of very large sets: existence
of a set \(\{t\mid t\notin t\}\) directly leads to a contradiction known as
Russel's paradox.
/ += . "Russel's paradox" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox

Among several possible methods to deal with this, Godel-Bernays version is to
separate sets into two types: "smaller" collections which are continued to be
called "sets" and "proper classes", which are collections so large that they
cannot be a member of any collection. Axiom of comprehension is carefully
modified so that set-builder never produces a collection having some class as
its element. In this setup Russel's paradox becomes a theorem: \(\{t\mid t\notin
t\}\) is a proper class.

The axiom of extensionality states that sets are equal when they _contain_ the
same elements. What would happen, if set theory were based on a dual notion of
_intentional equality_ (which will be denoted by \(\sim\) to tell it from
extensional one), where sets are equal when they are _contained_ in the same
collections?

>I0 _Axiom of intensionality_:

; math
>X \sim Y \equiv (X \in t \equiv Y\in t)

This looks bizarre: for any "normal" set \(X\) a collection of all sets
containing \(X\) as element is unmanageably huge. But as a matter of fact,
intentional equality is much older than extensional, it is variously known as
_Leibniz's law_, identity of indiscernibles and, in less enlightened age, as duck typing.
/ += . "identity of indiscernibles" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles
/ += . "duck typing" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing

There is a nice symmetry: while extensional equality myopically confuses small
sets (ur-elements), intensional equality cannot tell very large collections
(proper classes) from each other, because they are not members of anything and,
therefore, intentionally equal.

The whole extensional theory buildup can be mirrored easily by moving things
around \(\in\) sign:

Intensional subsets: \(X \unlhd Y \equiv (X\in t \Rightarrow Y\in t)\)

>I1 _Axiom of intensional comprehension (incomprehension)_:

; math
[u \mid P(u)]\in t \equiv P(t)

And associated operations:

>uniqum (or should it have been "s-ex-gleton?): \([t] = [u\mid u \sim t]\), note that \([t]\in t\).

>intentional union: \(X\triangledown Y = [t\mid X \in t \vee Y \in t]\)

>intentional intersection: \(X\triangle Y = [t\mid X \in t \wedge Y \in t]\)

>intentional complement: \(\Game X = [t \mid X \notin t]\)

>intentional pair: \([t,u] = [t]\triangledown [u]\)

>intentional ordered pair: \(<t,u> = [t, [t, u]]\)

>intentional power set: \(\mathfrak{J}(X) = [t \mid X \unlhd t\}\)

What do all these things _mean_? In extensional world, a set is a container,
where elements are stored. In intensional world, a set is a _property_, which
other sets might or might not enjoy. If \(t\) has property \(P\), it is written
as \(t\in P\). In the traditional notation, \(P\) is called a _predicate_ and
\(t\in P\) is written as \(P(t)\). The axiom of intentional equality claims that
sets are equal when they have exactly the same properties (quite natural,
right?). \(X\) is an intentional subset of \(Y\) when \(Y\) has all properties
of \(X\) and perhaps some more (this looks like a nice way to express
LSP). Intentional comprehension \([u \mid P(u)]\) is a set having exactly all
properties \(t\) for which \(P(t)\) holds and no other properties. Intentional
union of two sets is a set having properties of either and their intentional
intersection is a set having properties of both, _&c_. Uniqum \([P]\) is _the_
set that has property \(P\) and no other properties.
/ += . "LSP" -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle

Because intensional theory is a perfect dual of extensional nothing interesting
is obtained by repeating extensional construction, for example, by building
"intensional natural numbers" as

; math
0' = U, 1' = [0'], 2' = [0', 1'], \ldots (n + 1)' = [0', \ldots, n'], \ldots

What is more interesting, is how intensional and extensional twins meet. With
some filial affection it seems:

>by uniqum property \([\varnothing] \in\varnothing\), which contradicts the definition of \(\varnothing\), also

>set \([t\mid false]\) is not a member of any set (perhaps it's a proper class) and set \([t\mid true]\) is a member of every set, which is strange;

>a set of which a singleton can be formed has very shallow intentional structure. Indeed:

; math
\begin{array}{r@{\;}l@{\quad}}
                 &    x \unlhd y \\
        \equiv   &    \text{ \{ definition of intensional subset \} } \\
                 &    x\in t \Rightarrow y\in t \\
   \Rightarrow   &    \text{ \{ substitute \(\{x\}\) for \(t\) \} } \\
                 &    x\in \{x\} \Rightarrow y\in \{x\} \\
        \equiv   &    \text{ \{ \(x\in \{x\}\) is true by the singleton property, modus ponens \} } \\
                 &    y\in \{x\} \\
        \equiv   &    \text{ \{ the singleton property, again \} } \\
                 &    x = y
\end{array}

To get rid of contradictions and to allow intensional and extensional sets to
co-exist peacefully, domains on which singleton and uniqum operations are
defined must be narrowed. To be continued.
/ +* "must be narrowed" Like comprehension had to be limited to avoid paradoxes.
