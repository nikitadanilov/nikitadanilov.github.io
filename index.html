card is similar to various &quot;publishing&quot; tools that take as the input content
marked up with various formatting instructions and then render it in various
formats. It is much simpler than hugo or pandoc and its intended scope is more
of a component in a note-taking system, than a full-blown site publishing engine.

The input is a &quot;deck&quot;, which is a set of &quot;cards&quot;, each consisting of
&quot;fragments&quot;. Fragments correspond to paragraphs and things like code and math
displays in the output. Cards are used to ogranise content into &quot;series&quot;, they
can correspond to pages in the output, but not necessarily.

Decks, cards and fragments all have attributes.

The documentation is, naturally, maintained via card here.

<a name="index-00009"></a><p>This attaches the hyperlink to the part of the preceding paragraph matching the regular expression &quot;hugo&quot;.</p>
<a name="index-00010"></a><p>The separation between the text and the markup makes (in my personal opinion, that is) the content source more readable.</p><footer>&lt;&nbsp;<a href="series_trunk.html">trunk</a>&nbsp;<a href="phases.html#phases">&gt;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</footer></div>
