<a name="doors-00000"></a><p><a href="https://plus.google.com/102766894085961969420/posts">Paul Turner</a> gave a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXuZi9aeGTw">talk</a> about new threading interface, designed by Google, at this year <a href="http://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/2013/">Linux Plumbers Conference</a>:</p>
<a name="doors-00001"></a><p>The idea is, very roughly, to implement the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/ucontext.h.html">ucontext</a> interface with kernel support. This gives the benefits of kernel threads (<i>e.g.</i>, SMP support), while retaining fast context switches of user threads. <code class="inline">switchto_switch(tid)</code> call hands off control to the specified thread without going through the kernel scheduler. This is like <code class="inline">swapcontext(3)</code>, except that kernel stack pointer is switched too. Of course, there is still an overhead of the system call and return, but it is not as important as it used to be: the cost of normal context switch is dominated by the scheduler invocation (with all the associated locking), plus, things like TLB flushes drive the difference between user and kernel context switching further down.</p>
<a name="doors-00002"></a><p>I did something similar (but much more primitive) in 2001. The difference was that in that old implementation, one could switch context with a thread running in a different address space, so it was possible to make a &quot;continuation call&quot; to another process. This was done to implement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doors_(computing)">Solaris doors</a> RPC mechanism on Linux. Because this is an RPC mechanism, arguments have to be passed, so each context switch also performed a little dance to copy arguments between address spaces.</p><footer><a href="donne.html#donne">&lt;</a>&nbsp;<a href="series_blog_compact_reverse_flat.html">blog</a>&nbsp;<a href="euclid.html#euclid">&gt;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="affinity.html#affinity">&lt;</a>&nbsp;<a href="series_timeline_compact_reverse_flat.html">timeline</a>&nbsp;<a href="parmigianino.html#parmigianino">&gt;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</footer></div>
