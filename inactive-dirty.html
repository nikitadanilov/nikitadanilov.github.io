<a name="inactive-dirty-00000"></a><p>Found interesting discussion on linux-mm (Sept. 2002):</p>
<a name="inactive-dirty-00001"></a><p>AKPM and Rik (&quot;inactive_dirty list&quot;)</p>
<a name="inactive-dirty-00002"></a><p>[AKPM proposed separate inactive_dirty and inactive_clean lists to avoid excessive scanning of pages that cannot be reclaimed (due to then-new non-blocking VM scanner]:</p>
<a name="inactive-dirty-00003"></a><pre><code>    Riel:
    &gt; AKPM:
    &gt; &gt; - inactive_dirty holds pages which are dirty or under writeback.
    &gt; 
    &gt; &gt; - everywhere where we add a page to the inactive list will now
    &gt; &gt;   add it to either inactive_clean or inactive_dirty, based on
    &gt; &gt;   its PageDirty || PageWriteback state.
    &gt; 
    &gt; If I had veto power I&#x27;d use it here ;)
    &gt; 
    &gt; We did this in early 2.4 kernels and it was a disaster. The
    &gt; reason it was a disaster was that in many workloads we&#x27;d
    &gt; always have some clean pages and we&#x27;d end up always reclaiming
    &gt; those before even starting writeout on any of the dirty pages.
    &gt; 
    &gt; It also meant we could have dirty (or formerly dirty) inactive
    &gt; pages eating up memory and never being recycled for more active
    &gt; data.</code></pre>
<a name="inactive-dirty-00004"></a><p>And later in the same thread:</p>
<a name="inactive-dirty-00005"></a><pre><code>    AKPM:
    &gt; You&#x27;re proposing that we get that IO underway sooner if there

    &gt; sense as much as anything else ;)</code></pre>

    &gt; 
    &gt; Not really.  The correct formula will incorporate the allocation rate
    &gt; and the inactive dirty/clean balance.  The reclaim rate is not
    &gt; relevant, it is a time-delayed consequence of the above.  Relying on
    &gt; it in a control loop is simply asking for oscillation.</code></pre><footer><a href="inaccessible-cardinals.html#inaccessible-cardinals">&lt;</a>&nbsp;<a href="series_blog.html">blog</a>&nbsp;<a href="iso.html#iso">&gt;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="xnu-vm.html#xnu-vm">&lt;</a>&nbsp;<a href="series_timeline.html">timeline</a>&nbsp;<a href="compound-literals.html#compound-literals">&gt;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</footer></div>
